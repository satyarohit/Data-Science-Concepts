HIGH Bais: Too simple model<br/>
**What is Bias?**<br/>

Bias is the difference between the average prediction of our model and the correct value which we are trying to predict. A model with high bias pays very little attention to the training data and oversimplifies the model.<br/>

Simple definition: **“Resulted Error from Training Data!”**<br/>

**HIGH VARIANCE: Too complex model**<br/>
**What is a Variance?**<br/>

Variance is the variability of model prediction for a given data point or a value that tells us the spread of our data. A model with high variance pays a lot of attention to training data and does not generalize on the data which it hasn’t seen before.<br/>
